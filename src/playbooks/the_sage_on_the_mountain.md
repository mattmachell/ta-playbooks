title: 5. The Wise Sage on the Mountain
---

*Scene*: Wise TA sups their coffee of a morning.

*A supplicant developer approaches.*

*Supplicant Developer:* Oh wise and all knowing Technical Architect! What colour should our self-immolation machine be? Red or Blue? We bring offerings of biscuits and everything!

*TA:* Have you considered maybe not building a self-immolation machine?

*SD:* I... What?

There is a tendancy in organisations to treat Technical Architects as the all seeing wise sage who knows the answers.

Which is of course nonsense, as we're likely just as confused, plagued by doubt or unsure as the next person. Hopefully we have a bit of experince and have seen a problem and how to solve it technically before, but there's no gaurantee.

There is a further tendancy to only bring the questions to you that are pre-framed in the context the team already have. We want you to choose between technology A and B may be the question, but that's just what they've decided to bring to frame the discussion.
