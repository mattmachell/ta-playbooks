title: Ask why?
---

Use the question "why?" to drill down to the real reason people are asking for a thing, be that a piece of technology, a new feature, a new tool or to use a new language.

The trick is to ask it more than once. You may hear the term "5 whys" used as a technique in retrospectives and incident post-mortems. Use it to drill down to find the assumptions beneath what people are asking for and the causes beneath the symptoms that people are reporting.

## Other questions to ask

More variants on this exist. Good questions to drill down into a situation are:

- What are you trying to achieve?
- Who do you think this will benefit?
- What are the downstream impacts of doing this?
- Why do you think that will happen?
- Where did that information come from?
